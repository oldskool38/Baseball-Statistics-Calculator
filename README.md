# Introduction
This is a little application that I came up with in college and wrote in Java. Since I have lost the source code for that project, I am rewriting it, this time in C#, so that I have something to show potential employers.

# Getting Started
This application is designed to be self-contained and not dependent on external software. Simply download the application and install it to get started.

# Build and Test
The simplest way to test this program is to look up the stats of a baseball player and use those stats as the input and compare the output to the official stats.

# Contribute
The best way to contribute would be to suggest ways to simplify the code and make it run more smoothly, but most of all what would help is visual design suggestions.
